## How It Works

- **Chat Interface**: Lets you send messages to Nimbus
- **Veggie Meter**: Shows Nimbus's happiness level
  - Feed Nimbus veggies by clicking the "Feed Veggies" button
  - Happiness decreases over time, so keep feeding!
- **Nimbus's Responses**:
  - **Very Happy (80-100%)**: Enthusiastic, playful, lots of "wheeks" and "popcorns"
  - **Getting Hungry (40-79%)**: Friendlier but hints at wanting more veggies
  - **Hungry/Grumpy (0-39%)**: Demands food, very irritable!
